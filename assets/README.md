# Icon Requirements

This directory should contain:

1. **icon.png** (128x128px) - Main extension icon

   - Should represent Claude/AI + Terminal/Command concepts
   - Use colors that work well in both light and dark themes
   - Suggested: Terminal window with AI/brain symbol

2. **icon-32.png** (32x32px) - Activity bar icon
   - Smaller version of the main icon
   - Should be clearly visible at small sizes
   - High contrast for visibility

## Icon Design Suggestions

- **Color scheme**: Use blue/purple for AI, combined with terminal green
- **Symbolism**:
  - Terminal/command prompt symbol
  - AI/brain/chat bubble
  - Play button (for execution)
- **Style**: Modern, flat design that matches VS Code aesthetic

## Placeholder Usage

Until proper icons are created, VS Code will use default icons with the specified theme icons in package.json (terminal, play, run, gear, etc.).
